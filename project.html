  <p>Post-secondary education
    In 1897, Ambedkar's family moved to Mumbai where Ambedkar became the only untouchable enrolled at Elphinstone High
    School. In 1906, when he was about 15 years old, he married a nine-year-old girl, Ramabai. The match was arranged by
    the
    couple's parents, in accordance with prevailing custom at that time.[30]

    Studies at the University of Bombay
    In 1907, he passed his matriculation examination and in the following year he entered Elphinstone College, which was
    affiliated to the University of Bombay, becoming, according to him, the first from his Mahar caste to do so. When he
    passed his English fourth standard examinations, the people of his community wanted to celebrate because they
    considered
    that he had reached "great heights" which he says was "hardly an occasion compared to the state of education in
    other
    communities". A public ceremony was evoked, to celebrate his success, by the community, and it was at this occasion
    that
    he was presented with a biography of the Buddha by Dada Keluskar, the author and a family friend.[31]

    By 1912, he obtained his degree in economics and political science from Bombay University, and prepared to take up
    employment with the Baroda state government. His wife had just moved his young family and started work when he had
    to
    quickly return to Mumbai to see his ailing father, who died on 2 February 1913.In 1913, at the age of 22, Ambedkar
    was awarded a Baroda State Scholarship of £11.50 (Sterling) per month for three
    years under a scheme established by Sayajirao Gaekwad III (Gaekwad of Baroda) that was designed to provide
    opportunities
    for postgraduate education at Columbia University in New York City. Soon after arriving there he settled in rooms at
    Livingston Hall with Naval Bhathena, a Parsi who was to be a lifelong friend. He passed his M.A. exam in June 1915,
    majoring in economics, and other subjects of Sociology, History, Philosophy and Anthropology. He presented a thesis,
    Ancient Indian Commerce. Ambedkar was influenced by John Dewey and his work on democracy.[33]

    In 1916, he completed his second master's thesis, National Dividend of India – A Historic and Analytical Study, for
    a
    second M.A.[34] On 9 May, he presented the paper Castes in India: Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development before a
    seminar conducted by the anthropologist Alexander Goldenweiser. Ambedkar received his Ph.D. degree in economics at
    Columbia in 1927.Ambedkar was born on 14 April 1891 in the town and military cantonment of Mhow (now officially
    known as Dr Ambedkar
    Nagar) (now in Madhya Pradesh).[15] He was the 14th and last child of Ramji Maloji Sakpal, an army officer who held
    the
    rank of Subedar, and Bhimabai Sakpal, daughter of Laxman Murbadkar.[16] His family was of Marathi background from
    the
    town of Ambadawe (Mandangad taluka) in Ratnagiri district of modern-day Maharashtra. Ambedkar was born into a Mahar
    (dalit) caste, who were treated as untouchables and subjected to socio-economic discrimination.[17] Ambedkar's
    ancestors
    had long worked for the army of the British East India Company, and his father served in the British Indian Army at
    the
    Mhow cantonment.[18] Although they attended school, Ambedkar and other untouchable children were segregated and
    given
    little attention or help by teachers. They were not allowed to sit inside the class. When they needed to drink
    water,
    someone from a higher caste had to pour that water from a height as they were not allowed to touch either the water
    or
    the vessel that contained it. This task was usually performed for the young Ambedkar by the school peon, and if the
    peon
    was not available then he had to go without water; he described the situation later in his writings as "No peon, No
    Water".[19] He was required to sit on a gunny sack which he had to take home with him.[20]

    Ramji Sakpal retired in 1894 and the family moved to Satara two years later. Shortly after their move, Ambedkar's
    mother
    died. The children were cared for by their paternal aunt and lived in difficult circumstances. Three sons – Balaram,
    Anandrao and Bhimrao – and two daughters – Manjula and Tulasa – of the Ambedkars survived them. Of his brothers and
    sisters, only Ambedkar passed his examinations and went to high school. His original surname was Sakpal but his
    father
    registered his name as Ambadawekar in school, meaning he comes from his native village 'Ambadawe' in Ratnagiri
    district.[21][22][23][24] His Marathi Brahmin teacher, Krishnaji Keshav Ambedkar, changed his surname from
    'Ambadawekar'
    to his own surname 'Ambedkar' in school records.</p>

  <p>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar BR (14 April 1891 – 6 December 1956) was an Indian jurist, economist, social reformer and
    political leader who headed the committee drafting the Constitution of India from the Constituent Assembly debates,
    served as Law and Justice minister in the first cabinet of Jawaharlal Nehru, and inspired the Dalit Buddhist
    movement
    after renouncing Hinduism.

    After graduating from Elphinstone College, University of Bombay, Ambedkar studied economics at Columbia University
    and
    the London School of Economics, receiving doctorates in 1927 and 1923, respectively, and was among a handful of
    Indian
    students to have done so at either institution in the 1920s.[13] He also trained in the law at Gray's Inn, London.
    In
    his early career, he was an economist, professor, and lawyer. His later life was marked by his political activities;
    he
    became involved in campaigning and negotiations for partition, publishing journals, advocating political rights and
    social freedom for Dalits, and contributing to the establishment of the state of India. In 1956, he converted to
    Buddhism, initiating mass conversions of Dalits.[14]

    In 1990, the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, was posthumously conferred on Ambedkar. The salutation
    Jai
    Bhim (lit. "Hail Bhim") used by followers honours him. He is also referred to by the nickname Babasaheb (BAH-bə
    SAH-hayb), meaning "Respected Father".Ambedkar was born on 14 April 1891 in the town and military cantonment of Mhow
    (now officially known as Dr Ambedkar
